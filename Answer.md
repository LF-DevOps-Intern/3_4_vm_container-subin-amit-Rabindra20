1. Explain Working mechanism of Virtual Machine. <br/>
->A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. It can run in a window as a separate computing environment, often to run a different operating system or even to function as the user's entire computer experience as common on many people's work computers. The virtual machine is partitioned from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a VM can't interfere with the host computer's primary operating system.<br/>
This process is managed by software known as a hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for managing and provisioning resources like memory and storage from the host to guests. It also schedules operations in VMs so they donâ€™t overrun each other when using resources.<br/>
<br/>
2. Explain Working mechanism of Containers.<br/>
->Containers hold the components necessary to run desired software. These components include files, environment variables, dependencies and libraries. The host OS constrains the container's access to physical resources, such as CPU, storage and memory, so a single container cannot consume all of a host's physical resources.<br/>
